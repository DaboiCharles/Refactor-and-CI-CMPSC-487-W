# Refactor-and-CI-CMPSC-487-W
You need to refactor these assignments into useful Python packages. 

The steps for this include: 

create a GitHub repo (public or private -- add wagenhoffer to the repo)
establish a "build" system - Poetry, setuptools, etc.
refactor the code into src files and test files
ensure the code passes tests using Pytest, PyUnit, or Doctest
run a linter over the code using Flake8, Black, Pylama etc
run a coverage report 
Setup a Continuous Integration that runs the tests, linter, and coverage on the code on a push.
submit the link to your repo for a grade
If you hate the Python assignments, I will gladly provide Racket or Julia codes for you to do the same operations on.
